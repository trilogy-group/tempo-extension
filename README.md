## Build extension
```
npm run build
```
The build output will be located in `build` directory, which you can use to load extension into browser.

## Load extension into browser
[Here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/#unpacked) you can find instruction on how to install extension.

## Develop extension
Same as build, but watch allows you to build your changes on a fly.
```
npm run watch
```
